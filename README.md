Webpage for Lilypond-GUI web/desktop app

Welcome !

This repo has the source code for the web-based version of Lilypond-GUI

What is it ?
============

Lilypond-GUI can be used to create and edit music sheets. It has an interface that lets you focus on writing music, rather than Lilypond code. If you are not familiar with Lilypond code, it provides a markup language that compiles into PDF format. It is currently being used for that purpose, however, as you can guess it's not ideal for music writing purposes. Lilypond-GUI fills the missing gap - it eliminates the need to learn Lilypond markup, and provides you with an effective way to write music.
